        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="img/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>As a dedicated Web Application Developer, I am on a journey to master the art of creating seamless online experiences. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, C#, and .NET, and I thrive on weaving these technologies together to build robust and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        <p>I am driven by the little "aha" momentsâ€”those times when a tricky bug finally makes sense or when a project comes together just right. With a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering, I approach problems from diverse angles, seeing every hurdle as a chance to learn and grow.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am gaining hands-on experience at Datazymes, where I have contributed to multiple projects, including the development of dynamic front-end interfaces and the integration of secure file management systems. My work is guided by Agile methodologies and Software Engineering best practices, ensuring high-quality and reliable solutions.</p>
        <p>When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me exploring new technologies, learning from the community, and probably sipping too much coffee. Let's connect to explore exciting professional opportunities and collaborate on crafting impactful solutions together!</p>
